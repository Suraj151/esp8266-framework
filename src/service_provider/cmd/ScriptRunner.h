/**************************** Script Runner ***********************************
This file is part of the pdi stack.

This is free software. you can redistribute it and/or modify it but without any
warranty.

Reads a file of shell lines and runs each one through the shell that a typed
line goes through, so a script has the whole grammar without a grammar of its
own. Blank lines and comments are the only things it reads for itself.

Where it has stopped is held by the session rather than by the call stack, so
a line that asks for input can hand the terminal back and be picked up again
once the answer arrives.
