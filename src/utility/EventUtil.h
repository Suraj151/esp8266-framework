The EventUtil class provides a mechanism for managing and executing events
within the PDI stack. It allows components to register event listeners and
trigger events with optional arguments. This utility is designed to work
with the iUtilityInterface, which provides the underlying utility functions
required for event handling.

 * The EventUtil class provides a centralized mechanism for handling events

 *
 * Features:
 * - Register event listeners with specific event names.
 * - Trigger events and execute associated callbacks.
 * - Maintain a history of the last event and its timestamp.
