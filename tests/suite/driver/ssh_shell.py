"""
A board reached over its own ssh server, driven as a shell.

This transport is also a test of the thing it runs over: the framework's ssh
server does the key exchange, the mac negotiation and the auth, and paramiko is
a client that was written for none of it in particular. A suite that runs here
proves interoperability as much as it proves the commands.

Unlike the serial and host transports there is no boot banner and no login
prompt — the ssh layer has already authenticated by the time a channel opens,
so wait_for_boot and login are satisfied without sending anything.
