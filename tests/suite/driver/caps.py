"""
What the target in front of us can actually do.

A board is built with a subset of the services and commands, and which subset
is a compile time decision the test suite has no way to know in advance. So it
asks: `help` for the commands, `mount` and `df` for the filesystems, `service
list` for the services. A test that names something absent is skipped with the
reason, which is very different from failing.
