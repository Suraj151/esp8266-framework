"""
The mqtt client, tested by being the broker it talks to.

A broker of our own is stood up on a free port and the board is pointed at it
through the web portal, so every assertion is about what actually went out on
the wire: the CONNECT flags, the will, the topics, the qos, the keepalive.
Reading the config back from the portal would only prove the portal stored it.

The machine running these tests usually already has a broker on 1883 for real
work. Pointing the board at that one would put test traffic on it and leave
retained messages behind, so this binds an ephemeral port instead and takes it
away again at the end.

The board's mqtt config lives in its database and outlives the run, so it is
read first and written back afterwards. Setting it up costs a reconnect and
five seconds of settling, so the whole suite shares one broker and one
connection, set up on the first test that needs it and restored once at the
end through `Target.at_exit`. The tests that have to disturb that connection —
dropping it, changing the topics — come last on purpose.
