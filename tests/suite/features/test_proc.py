"""
Tasks and services as the shell reports them.

Mostly read-only about the live services, so a signal is never aimed at one of
them. Where a positive signal has to be proven, the test makes its own task to
aim at: `watch` and `top` register a background scheduler task the session owns,
so `renice`, `pkill` and `killall` can act on that and never on a service. The
task is torn down again by name, or by pid if the signal under test failed.
