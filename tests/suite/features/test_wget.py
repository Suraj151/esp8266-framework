"""
The download command, against an origin stood up for the run.

Two things make this suite different from the others. The first is that the
board has to reach back to this machine, so a failure to connect is reported as
a skip with the reason rather than as a wall of failures — a firewall or an
access point with client isolation stops it and neither is a defect in the
command.

Everything here is fetched over plain http and nothing here uses https, which
is deliberate rather than incidental. A tls handshake needs ram the smallest
supported board does not have to spare, so putting one in this suite would make
a download test fail for a reason that has nothing to do with downloading. The
tls stack has its own suite, gated on its own flag. Anything added below is
http, and the origin serves nothing else.

The second thing is the progress display, which is the reason several of these
tests exist. The bar rewrites one line with carriage returns, so a carriage
return that survives in the output marks a redraw: the shell driver has already
taken the line-ending CR off the end of every line by the time a test sees it.
The helpers below fold CRLF anyway, so they read the same against a raw capture
as against a driver that has normalised it.

The last test in the file is the one that matters most: a command run after a
download must answer for itself. A display that redraws mid-command is exactly
the shape that has desynchronised this harness before, and a download that left
the reader a command behind would show up there and nowhere else.
