"""
The line editor, driven a keystroke at a time.

This is the suite that gains the most from running on real hardware. The C++
tests in test_terminal_editing.cpp feed the editor through a string terminal in
the same process; here the same keys cross a uart or an ssh channel, arrive in
whatever chunks the transport chooses, and the echo comes back the same way.
Escape sequences that work in-process have a real chance of not working here.

Everything is asserted on what the target did, never on what it echoed, so a
transport that redraws differently does not break the suite.

    ssh through the crypto layer on a busy board — delivers the previous step's
