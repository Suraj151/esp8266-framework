"""
scp against the board, both protocols it can meet.

The device has no legacy SCP: a client that speaks the old exec-driven protocol
is answered with one line telling it to use sftp, and the channel is closed
rather than left hanging, which is what a legacy client used to do. Modern scp
carries the file over the SFTP subsystem instead, and `scp -s` names that
protocol explicitly so the test does not depend on the client's default.

The transfer tests drive the real scp binary, so they need it on the test host
and a way to answer its password prompt; both are skipped for when either is
missing. The refusal test needs neither and runs wherever paramiko does.
