"""
mDNS: what the board calls itself on the local network, and whether it answers.

Two halves. The shell half asks the service what it thinks it is advertising
and holds it against `net ip`; that runs anywhere. The network half puts a real
query on the multicast group and requires the answer to come **from the board**,
which needs the test machine on the same segment as the board and an access
point that forwards multicast — consumer hotspots often do not, so it skips
with that reason rather than failing.

Answers from anyone else are ignored on purpose. A developer machine usually
runs its own responder and will answer for a name it has cached, so a test that
accepts the first reply on the group ends up testing the test machine.
