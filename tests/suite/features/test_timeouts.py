"""
The idle and handshake timeouts, observed by waiting them out.

These are the behaviours only a clock reveals: a connection that stops being
used is reclaimed so its session slot is not held for ever, and a connection
that never finishes its handshake is not left half-open. Each test opens its
own connection to the board by address — independent of the transport the suite
is reached on — idles it, and checks the board honoured the timeout its config
promises (SshConfig.h / TelnetConfig.h). The shell timeouts are minutes long,
so all but the handshake one are slow.

The one thing that has to be arranged: while a separate connection is left to
time out, the suite's own lane must be kept alive, or it is reaped too and the
run cannot continue. _keepalive touches it on a period well inside its window.
