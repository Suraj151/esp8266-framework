"""
The shell grammar itself, over whatever transport the target is reached by.

Redirection and pipelines belong to the shell, not to any one command: the
command being redirected does not know it is being redirected, and the command
downstream of a pipe does not know its input was not a file. These check that
on a real board, where the output an operator sees is the only evidence.

These mirror tests/host/system/test_shell_redirect.cpp.
