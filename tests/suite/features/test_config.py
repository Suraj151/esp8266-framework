The /etc config surface and runtime service enable, on a real board.

These cover what the host suite cannot: that a config file written by the device
comes back off it intact, that a rewrite keeps the rest of the file, and that
`service enable/disable` persists somewhere `cat` can see.

The service these act on is chosen at run time and is never one the session is
arriving over, never an essential one, and is put back the way it was found. A
test that disabled the transport it was speaking through would take the rest of
