"""
The ssh server as a server, rather than as a way to reach the shell.

Every device-tier run over ssh already exercises the key exchange, the mac
negotiation and password auth — if those were broken nothing else would run at
all. What is left is the part a shell transport never touches: the host keys on
disk, the config that turns each auth method on, public-key authentication, the
keygen command, and the bound on how many sessions may be open at once.

These dial the ssh port themselves rather than using the session's transport,
so the same assertions run whether the suite arrived over serial, telnet or ssh.
