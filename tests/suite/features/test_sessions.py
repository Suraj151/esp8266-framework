"""
More than one session at a time, and what a session leaves behind.

These need a transport that can dial the target twice, so they skip on a board
reached over a single serial cable. They are the only tests that cover what
happens when a client disappears rather than logging out — the case a network
shell hits routinely and a serial console never does.
