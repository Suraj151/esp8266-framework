Registration and running for the transport-agnostic feature suites.

A test here is written against a shell and nothing else, so the same assertion
runs against the host process, a board on a serial cable and a board over ssh.
What the target cannot do it is skipped for, by name and with the reason, so a
build that compiled a service out reports that rather than a wall of failures.

Tests share one session: a board cannot be restarted between them the way a
host process can. So each works inside its own directory and puts back anything
it changed.
