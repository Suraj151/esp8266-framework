The file commands, over whatever transport the target is reached by.

These mirror tests/host/system/test_commands_fs.cpp. The difference is what
they are allowed to believe: the C++ versions check the filesystem directly
through __i_fs, and here there is only the shell, so every result is read back
with a command. That is the point — on real flash it is the command output an
operator sees that has to be right.
